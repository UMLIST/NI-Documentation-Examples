# Getting Started

Before running the examples, make sure your development PC is connected to the PXI. The easist way is to connect using an ethernet cable and make sure your connection's IP address contains the same first three sets of numbers as the PXI (posted on the unit, probably 141.211.142.XXX) and are on the same subnet (255.255.255.0). You can check to see if the PXI shows up as a Remote Device in NI MAX. If it is there, you are good. 

Because we have an embedded real-time target, you MUST open LabVIEW VI's through a project. Otherwise, the modules will not be found. Below is a snapshot of what this will look like:
